README
======

This is following along with a [tutorial](http://samurails.com/tutorial/single-table-inheritance-with-rails-4-part-1/) on Single Table Inheritance

This has got some extra stuff in it that I am not sure I needed - this could have been done without the tribe I think?

There is more to be read at [eugenius](http://eewang.github.io/blog/2013/03/12/how-and-when-to-use-single-table-inheritance-in-rails/), the [rubyonrails.org notes on Active Record Inheritance](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Inheritance.html) and in [Martin Fowlers catalog](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html)
